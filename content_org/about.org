** Emmanuel-Jelome Fonseca

   [[/img/me.png]]

   I'm a Software Developer at /Tradebyte/[fn:1] in Ansbach, Bavaria
   who is in a constant /quest/[fn:2] of /self-discovery/[fn:3].

-----

** Self-discoveries so far

*** On a [[/about#personal][personal]] level

    - an [[/about#agreeable-and-open][Agreeable and Open]] person
    - with an [[/about#infp-t][INFP-T]] personality
    - who has an [[/about#average-iq][Average IQ]]
    - with quite a few [[/about#interests][interests]] (see also [[/about#other-tests][other tests]] and [[/about#pseudosciences][pseudosciences]])

*** On a [[/about#technical][technical]] level

    - a /=Python=/[fn:4] programmer [[/about#at-work][at work]]
    - and a /=Ruby=/[fn:5] enthusiast on [[/about#hobbies][hobbies]]
    - aims to become a *modern* /=LISPer=/[fn:6] using /=Clojure=/[fn:7] in [[/about#the-future][the future]]

*** On waking life

    Mostly associated to only a few but important people in life --- direct family, close friends and good colleagues.
    Striving to only spend time on genuine relationships and meaningful activities --- as /Nietzsche/[fn:8] wrote:

    #+BEGIN_quote
    Is life not a thousand times too short for us to bore ourselves?
    #+END_quote

** Personal

   Self-discovery is quite a task --- requiring openness to explore the potentials and courage to accept the limitations.

   Here are some of the platforms I used that /might be/ credible enough to reveal one's identity --- except that their accuracy weren't guaranteed.

*** Agreeable and Open

    According to /Understand Myself/[fn:9], which evaluates personalities based on /The Big Five Aspect Scales/[fn:10],
    I lean towards /*Agreeableness*/[fn:11] (=80/100=, highest trait) and /*Openness*/[fn:12] (=90/100=, highest aspect),
    which suggests a positive link on entrepreneurship and creative work.

    Ironically, being low in /*Conscientiousness*/[fn:13] (=11/100=, lowest trait) and very low in *Intellect* (=5/100=, lowest aspect) implies negative competence in administrative and repetitive tasks as I prefer leadership and team play than managerial and egotism.

    The level of /*Neuroticism*/[fn:14] (=50/100=, balanced view) validates my neutral viewpoint in life, such that, individuals can be good or evil, happy or unhappy depending on their choices, actions *and* circumstances in life.

    It was also a bit surprising to learn that I'm not as /*Introverted*/[fn:15] (=57/100=) as I thought --- but still --- I get fairly exhausted in crowds unless that crowd are the people I deem important. Nevertheless, parties will never be my thing.

*** INFP-T

    According to /16Personalities/[fn:16], which assess people based on Myers–Briggs Type Indicator[fn:17] (MBTI), I lean towards /*INFP*/[fn:18]-/*T*/[fn:19].
    Note, however, that Myers–Briggs' personality test is criticized in its scientific accuracy and even labelled as a /pseudoscience/[fn:20].

    On the other hand, INFP-T suits introversion (=I=), agreeableness (=__F_=) and openness (=_N_P=) pretty well.
    Turbulence (=-T=) seems to be a recent add-on to increase variants although it's a good fit for perfectionists who self-doubts (see /impostor syndrome/[fn:21]).

*** Average IQ

    According to /Mensa Norway/[fn:22], which tests individual's cognitive abilities, I have an IQ of about *=105=* (which is *average*, so to speak).
    Of course, I could have achieved a higher score by means of repetition, but that will be a fool's errand, as it merely will increase my test score, not IQ.

    Having said that, however, IQ, *in my humble opinion*, is overrated --- which might also be the reason that I'm average per se --- and mustn't be viewed as the end all be all of any individual.

    While having higher IQ has its own merits, it shouldn't be used as an absolute measure.
    The fact that life treats everyone equally regardless of intelligence illustrates that.
    So rather than chasing intelligence and accumulatation knowledge --- seek wisdom and find out the truth.

*** Other tests

    There were also old tests that I took and somehow kept their scores:

    - *Highly Sensitive Person* (=19/27=) in /SPS/[fn:23]
    - *Mid-brained dominant* (=50/50=) in brain dominance
    - *=1%= more feminine* than most men in /gender role/[fn:24]
    - *Associative thinker* in terms of thought process
    - Uses /*defensive pessimism*/[fn:25] as the /cognitive strategy/[fn:26]

*** Pseudosciences

    I also checked a few /mysticism/[fn:27] outside science (see /noumenon/[fn:28]):

    - *Diamond* as the /birthstone/[fn:29] (both month and day)
    - *Aries* (Ram &#9800;), *fire* element, *cardinal* quality in /western astrology/[fn:30]
    - *Earth Dragon* (*Dragon* animal, *yang earth* element) in /chinese zodiac/[fn:31]

    To be fair, they got it right in numbers (*=7=*) and colors (*silver*, *gray*).

*** Interests

    Outside of computers, I like:

    - Art (drawing)
    - Music (flute)
    - Philosophy (metaphysics)

-----

** Technical

   I find joy in constant exposure to different kinds technologies --- old and new --- that can provide unique perspectives to solve different problems.

*** At Work

    As a Software Developer,
    we use /=Python=/[fn:4] as the programming language
    with /=Django=/[fn:32] as the web framework
    that sits on top of /=AWS=/[fn:33].
    Strangely enough, I have proclivity with /=JavaScript=/[fn:34] esp. when it comes to UIs.

*** Hobbies

    At home, I intentionally use the opposing technologies on hobby projects to have different perspectives such as
    /=Ruby=/[fn:5] as the programming language
    with /=Ruby on Rails=/[fn:35] as the web framework.
    The combination of /=GitHub=/[fn:36] (versioning),
    /=GitHub flow=/[fn:37] (branching model),
    /=Travis CI=/[fn:38] (building)
    and /=Heroku=/[fn:39] (hosting)
    with /=Heroku Flow=/[fn:40] (CD workflow)
    for a complete /=CI/CD=/[fn:41] pipeline
    --- and as an advocate of /=open source=/[fn:42],
    I license these hobby projects under /=MIT=/[fn:43].

    On the local development, I also use different sets of tools (preferred but not intentional) to do these hobby projects such as
    /=Arch Linux=/[fn:44] as the operating system,
    /=i3=/[fn:45] as the desktop environment,
    /=BASH=/[fn:46] as the shell,
    /=Make=/[fn:47] as the build tool,
    /=Spacemacs=/[fn:48] (an /=Emacs=/[fn:49] distribution) as the text editor
    and /=Markdown=/[fn:50] (for simple writing)
    or /=Org mode=/[fn:51] (for complex writing) for documentation.

*** The Future

    The ideal future, that I aim, taking both personal and technical sides into account, is to become a *modern* /=LISPer=/[fn:6] using /=Clojure=/[fn:7] / /=ClojureScript=/[fn:52]
    with the main focus on user interfaces and the guiding principles of /*HCI*/[fn:53].

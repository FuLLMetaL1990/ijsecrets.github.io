I'm a Software Developer at [Tradebyte Software GmbH](https://tradebyte.com)
in [Ansbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansbach), Germany.
<br />A person in constant quest of [self-discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself).

Summary

On the [personal](#personal) side: [Agreeable and Open](#agreeable_and_open), [INFP-T](#infp-t) with [average IQ](#average_iq) (see also [other tests](#other_tests), [pseudosciences](#pseudosciences) and [interests](#interests)).
<br />On the [technical](#technical) side: [Python](https://www.python.org) programmer [at work](#at_work), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) enthusiast on [hobbies](#hobbies) and preparing an [ideal future](#ideal_future) as a modern [LISPer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_\(programming_language\)).

Waking life is mostly associated to only a few but important people in life &mdash; direct family, close friends and good colleagues.
<br />Striving to spend limited amounts of time only on genuine relationships and meaningful activities &mdash; as [Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) wrote:
<br />*Is life not a thousand times too short for us to bore ourselves?*

<hr />

Personal
--------

Self-discovery is quite a task &mdash; requiring full honesty to explore the potentials and extreme courage to accept the imperfections.

Here are a few hints received from platforms that *might be* credible to reveal one's true identity &mdash; except accuracy isn't guaranteed.

#### Agreeable and Open ####

According to [Understand Myself](https://www.understandmyself.com), which evaluates personalities based on [The Big Five Aspect Scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_Aspect_Scales),
I lean towards [Agreeableness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness) and [Openness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness).
That is, being high on *Agreeableness* (`80/100`, highest trait) and very high in *Openness* (`90/100`, highest aspect) suggests a positive link on entrepreneurship and creative work.
Ironically, being low in [Conscientiousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness) (`11/100`, lowest trait) and very low in *Intellect* (`5/100`, lowest aspect) implies negative competence in administrative and repetitive tasks.

The level of [Neuroticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism) (`50/100`, balanced view) confirms my neutral stand about life, such that, individuals can be good or evil, happy or unhappy, depending on their choices and circumstance in life.
An [Introvert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Introversion) (`57/100`) who is exhausted in crowds unless that crowd are people deemed important.


#### INFP-T ####

According to [16Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com), which assess people based on [Myers–Briggs Type Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) (MBTI),
I lean towards [INFP](https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality)-[T](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/assertive-mediator-infp-a-vs-turbulent-mediator-infp-t).

*Myers–Briggs* personality test, however, is criticized in its scientific accuracy (even labelled as [pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience)).
On the other hand, `INFP-T` very well suits introversion (`I`), agreeableness (`__F_`) and openness (`_N_P`).
Turbulence (`-T`) seems to be a recent addition to increase variants though fits perfectionists who self-doubts (see also [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)).

#### Average IQ ####

According to [Mensa Norway](http://test.mensa.no), which tests individual's cognitive abilities, I have an IQ of `105` (average).
Of course, one can achieve higher scores by means of repetition, but that is a fool's errand, as it's mere improving test scores, not IQ.

However, IQ, to me, is overrated, and must not be seen as the end all be all of any individual &mdash; although higher IQ have its own merits, it can never be the final judge.
For instance, one can be exceptionally intelligent but miserable while the other is not but successful &mdash; and that's the beauty in life: it does not descriminate intelligence.

### Other tests ###

These were the other tests taken, but have forgotten the platforms used, only the scores that were far more important.

The results were:
*Highly Sensitive Person* (`19/27`) [HSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_processing_sensitivity),
*mid-brained dominant* (`50/50`) in brain dominance,
*`1%` more feminine* than most men in gender role,
*associative thinker* on thought process (ease of connecting ideas but difficulty in providing concrete answers)
and [defensive pessimism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_pessimism) as the [cognitive strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_strategy).

### Pseudosciences ###

Here are also [mysticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism) in an effort to explore what science can't (see [noumenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noumenon)).

Using birthdate as the sole reference, the results were:
*diamond* in [birthstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthstone) (both month and day),
*Aries* (*Ram*, symbol &#9800;), *fire* element and *cardinal* quality in [western astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_astrology)
and *Earth Dragon* (*Dragon* animal, *yang earth* element) in [chinese zodiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac).

To be fair, they got it right in numbers (`7`) and colors (*silver* and *gray*).

### Interests ###

Outside of computers, likes art (drawings), music (flutes) and philosophy (metaphysics).

<hr />

Technical
---------

There is joy in constant exposure to different kinds technologies, old and new &mdash; unique mindsets to approach and solve problems.

### At Work ###

As a Software Developer at Tradebyte Software GmbH,
we use *Python* as the programming language
with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) as the web framework
that sits on top of [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) cloud platform.
Strangely enough, I have proclivity with [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) esp. when it comes to UIs.

### Hobbies ###

At home, I intentionally use the opposing technologies on my hobby projects to see a different perspective, such as:
*Ruby* as the programming language
with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) as the web framework.
The combination of [GitHub](https://github.com) (versioning),
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) (builds)
and [Heroku](https://heroku.com) (hosting)
for a complete [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) pipeline
&mdash; and as an advocate of [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source),
these projects are licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).


On the local development, I also use different sets of tools (preferred, not intentional) to do the hobby projects, they are:
[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) as the operating system,
[i3](https://i3wm.org) as the desktop environment,
[BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash) as the shell,
[Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_\(software\)) as the build tool,
[Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org) (an [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) distribution) as the text editor
and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) (simple writing)
or [Org mode](https://orgmode.org) (complex writing) for documentation.

### Ideal Future ###

The ideal future, that I aim, taking personal and technical sides into account, is to become a *modern LISPer*
([Clojure](https://clojure.org)), focusing on user interfaces ([ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org))
with the guiding principles of [HCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction)
to teach the concepts and build systems of the future.

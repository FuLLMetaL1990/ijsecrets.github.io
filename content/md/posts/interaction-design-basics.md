-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently took an HCI by [Alan Dix](https://alandix.com) of the [Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org) (abbreviated: **IDF**).
And this document is a way for me to re-interpret the understood knowledge gained from the lecture.
It solely focuses on [Lesson 2: Interaction Design](https://www.interaction-design.org/courses/human-computer-interaction/lessons/2), which may or may not be accurate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Design
------

### What are we designing? ###

For most people, the answer might obviously be, an **interface** (visual, what is seen); but that is rather lacking as an answer.
The answer is: we are designing an **interaction** (not just an **what it is** [interface], but also **what to do with it** [interaction]).

#### The camera example ####

Think of the camera:

- What is a camera?
- Why use a camera?

It will rather be disappointing to think that a camera is all about how it looks (interface).
A better thought about a camera is that it is about taking photographs (interaction).

And a much deeper thought (emotion) is that, a camera is a device that is used to capture moments,
and being able to collect these moments and keep them as memories that we can revisit.

#### Interaction, not just interfaces ####

And that is what we should be designing,
just like the camera, design is about:

- a **series of actions** (view, click) to accomplish a goal (take photographs)
- but **not just the immidiate interaction**, it is the **whole flow** (overall use)

### Intervention not just artifacts ###

It is also not just about the thing we are designing (**artifact**, e.g. camera),
but also how the design can change things (**intervention**, e.g. how people will treat photos).

### What is a design? ###

A design is **achieving a goal within constraints**.

- Goal means **purpose** (who is it for and why would they need it)
- Constraints mean **limitations** (time, budget, expertise, platform)

To achieve a goal within constraints is about dealing with **trade-offs**.

- It is **deciding between what we want and what we can really achieve**
- Trade-offs are at the heart of working in a design

#### Understand the materials ####

- Computers (platforms, tools)
- People (psychological, social, human error)
- And how these two interacts (complementarity)

#### Human error ####

Human error is the typical excuse when people fail to use a design properly,
but in reality, human error occurs as a result of a **poor design**.
They are really **design errors** that did not took enough consideration
the **human characteristics and limitations** that led to mistakes and accidents.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The design process
------------------

### The 5 Stages in Interaction Design ###

The general flow of Interaction Design Process .

It revolves around a design process **from needs to fulfillment**.

#### Step 1: Research

The first step is conducting researches to find out **what users want and need**.

If we do not know what users want and need, how can we provide it?
It is easy to assume what users want and need but it often leads to further misunderstanding.

There are some approaches to gain a better understanding of users, such as:

- Observation (look, watch)
- Interviews (talk, ask)
- See existing solutions (relevant things that they are already using)

#### Step 2: Analysis ####

Once a good understanding of users' want or need is achieved,
comes analysis, which is to make sense of the understood information.

- By **task analysis** that splits an action into smaller steps
- Thru a **scenario** which expresses a specific need and how to achieve it

#### Step 3: Design ####

The main point of action in the design process where the design is actually being worked on.
It is the stage where:

- **principles** (general rules) are applied
- **guidelines** (rules for specific people and technology) are followed
- **dialogues** (how users can interact with the design) are explored

####  Step 4: Prototype ####

A **prototype** is sample of the design.
It is giving a taste for users to **try it out**.

**Remember: We never get it right the first time**, because:

- No one fully understands people
- No one fully understands situations

And a prototype allows us to have a real-world:

- **heuristics** (design compliance with recognized **usability principles**)
- **cultural probe** (fragmentary clues about people's lives and thoughts that can be used to inspire our imagination)
- **technology probe** (seeing people's reaction on the new technology and how it can disrupt their existing routines)

#### Step 5: Implement and Deploy ####

The bringing up to life of the design for the world to see.
It is when users will actually use the design in their lives.
It is also when the real work begins to sustain the design, such as:

- Architecture (how its work together, e.g. people, hardware, systems, networks)
- Infrastructure (the actual components that will facilitate the architecture)
- Documentation (how to use the artifact)
- Maintenance (how to maintain the artifact)
- Help System (e.g. user assistance thru software)
- Help Desk (e.g. customer support thru operators)
- and see the actual intervention

#### The artifact ####

All these steps of the design process were done to produce the artifact (product).
It is all of these steps that were executed to create the intervention (change).

### Learn what to prioritize ###

Because of these many stages of the design process, how can one person do it all alone?
The answer is: **one person cannot**; because of constraints and trade-offs that will eventually occur.

And in the process, one will invest more on some areas while simplifying the rest, hence, **compromise**.

One will also find that **the most difficult thing is not finding or solving a problem,**
**but deciding which of these problems to solve.** Due to limitations, all problems cannot be solved at once.

The irony is that, **a perfectly designed system is the result of a poor design process**.
Because too much time have been spent on the design process and time was not spent efficiently.
So unless we are within a multi-million dollar business, we should really **know when to stop**.

#### Desire vs. Disaster ####

And out of these problems begs the question, **what to prioritize?**
The two major criterias of where to put an effort are:

- **desire** (what make users want to use the product)
- **disaster** (what make users stop using the product)

So prioritize fixing the disaster first, then the desire.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User Focus
----------

### Know thy user ###

As the most famous delphic maxims states, **know thyself**.
This is also true for users who will use the design.
It is perhaps, the most important aspect in interaction design.

#### Who are the users? ####

- We are not the users (the **false consensus-effect**)
- But we can be one of them
- Talk to them (from informal to a formal way)
- Watch them (observe: know what they say from what they really do)
- Use our imagination (put ourselves in their shoes, **empathize**)

An expert can be the worst person to know who they are (the **curse of knowledge**).

#### Personas ####

A persona is fictional representation of a user that will use the design.
The richer the description of the persona, the more we will think like the user.

#### Cultural probes ####

Cultural probes encultures us on users' way of life.
It helps us get a realistic understanding of users' current situation.

#### Technology probes ####

Technology probes enables us to see people's reaction when presented to new technologies.
It helps us to understand how these technologies can change people's way of life.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenarios
---------

Like personas, scenarios are fictional stories of users that will use the design.
But unlike personas, it focuses on users' **actions needed to achieve a certain goal**.

### Scenarios as walkthroughs ###

Scenarios allow us to define walkthroughs that imagined users will act out, such as:

- What users will see (visual, e.g. they see a button)
- What users will do (behavior, e.g. they clicked that button)
- What users are thinking (motive, e.g. why they clicked and what they expected)

### Scenarios and its limitations ###

While scenarios can provide a clearer picture of how users can possibly interact with the design,
it has its own limitations, such that:

- it cannot represent all users (each users are unique; thinks and acts differently)
- it can miss the unintended (it is linear, it cannot provide all actions and expections)
- it needs to be based on insight and research with real users (to avoid assumptions)
- it must use valid personas to expose real problems and important areas to improve

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Navigation
----------

The navigation defines how users can move between screens (desktop) or pages (web browsers, devices).
It is the flow in the design that allow users to find their way around the system.

### Multiple levels of design ###

There are four fundamental levels of a design, they are:

| Level (In Desktop) | In Web                     | In Device               | Example                       |
| :----------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| Widget             | Tag                        | Control                 | Menu, Button                  |
| Screen             | Page                       | Layout                  | Layout, placement of Widgets  |
| Navigation         | Structure                  | Modes                   | Linking one screen to another |
| Environment        | Web browser, other website | The World, other device | The platform (OS, other apps) |

### Design structures ###

The structure of the design defines how each of these design levels can fit together, they are:

#### Local ####

The local structure defines the **current** screen that users are at.
It tells them where they currently are in the system (**somewhere**).

##### Four golden rules #####

There are four golden rules for the **local** structure that must be answered for users, namely:

| Question            | Answer      | Example             |
| :------------------ | :---------- | :------------------ |
| Where they are?     | Scent       | Breadcrumbs         |
| What can they do?   | Action      | Click a link        |
| What will happen?   | Expectation | Go to the next page |
| What have happened? | Outcome     | Now in that page    |

##### Information scent #####

[Peter Pirolli](http://www.peterpirolli.com) and [Stuart Card](https://web.archive.org/web/20070209223029/http://www2.parc.com/istl/projects/uir/people/stuart/stuart.htm), along with colleagues in Xerox PARC, developed the **information foraging** theory.
It is an analogy that like wild animals gathering food, humans do the same to gather information cues online.
It is considered the most important concept that emerged in HCI research since 1993.

Under this theory is the most important concept called **information scent**.
It states that, like animals that rely on scents to guide them finding a prey, so as humans rely on information cues.
But as users get less useful information, the more likely they will stop going further and just move to another source.

A rule of thumb regarding information scent is that **a good scent leads you straight to the goal**.
Users have a goal in mind and it's our job to help them reach that goal as short and fast as possible.

#### Global ####

The global structure defines the **relationships** of each screens.
It helps users to navigate throughout the whole system.

##### Hierarchy structure #####

This is the most common structure by which screens are organized by relevance.
It is top-down, tree-like, one-to-many; it is an **information-oriented** structure.

The main advantage of this structure is that each part can clearly define its own function.
A big disadvantage, however, is that the more the functions, the deeper (**depth**) it becomes.
And the deeper users are in the system, the more difficult for them to **track** their location.

###### Miller's Magical Number: Seven, Plus or Minus Two ######

In 1956, Cognitive psychologist, [George A. Miller](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armitage_Miller) of [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu) published:
[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller).
Often referred to as **Miller's law**, which states that humans can only hold an average of 7 chunks in short-term memory.

This is typically misused in design, esp. suggesting the number of items in menus.
Because users do not really memorize the number of items in menus, they **scan**.

However, it is not to say that the number of items in a menu does not matter.
In fact, if there are too much items in a menu (**breadth**), it becomes difficult to scan.
And if the menu has less items but is too deep (**depth**), it becomes difficult to track.

##### Network structure #####

This is an alternative structure by which screens are organized according to **dialogues**.
It is not linear which lead users to different screens; it is a **task-oriented** structure.

The main advantage of this structure is its flexibility to organize screens depending on their context.
A big disadvantage, on the other hand, is that it is more complicated because outcomes depend on choices.

#### Between applications ####

The overall user experience does not simply revolve in one application.
The design does not end with just the local and global structures
but also its functionalities to be consistent with other applications.

An example is how we move information (e.g. **cut, copy, and paste** between applications.
And in terms of websites or web applications, going to and from external pages.
A common way to maintain consistency are **style guides** (e.g. [Apple](https://www.apple.com)'s [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines)).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Screen Design
-------------

The screen design defines what users will see on the screen, one at a time.

### Basic principles ###

1. Ask: What users want to do? (action)
2. Think: What are they looking for? (expectation)
3. Design: **form follows function** (appearance equals intention; \[ref: Architect, [Louis Sullivan](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Sullivan)'s maxim\])

### Screen elements ###

There are a number of elements that can expose the functions of forms on a screen, such as:

1. Grouping (**combine** related items)
2. Order (**natural ordering** of items)
3. Decoration (**emphasize** important items)
4. Alignment (**readability** of items)
5. Whitespace (**separation** of items)

### Affordances ###

In his 1966 book, [The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems](http://web.flu.cas.cz/scan/323542127.pdf), psychologist, [James J. Gibson](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Gibson),
coined the term **affordance**, that he later defined in his 1979 book, [The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception](https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-u5hmFOvOM2Civ4Gz/THE+ECOLOGICAL+APPROACH+TO+VISUAL+PERCEPTION_djvu.txt),
which states that affordance **implies the complementarity of the animal and the environment.**

In terms of design, affordances provide users with strong cues on how objects they see can operate.
Objects are self-explanatory (**obvious**) and do not need further instructions on how to use them.

### Countries and cultures ###

A product that wants to enter a global (international) market, requires understanding of varying cultures.
Different users of different places and cultures wants their identity and practices to be respected.
There are general design considerations when dealing with different countries and cultures, such as:

1. Translation (**t9n** [translation]; translating from one language to another)
1. Localization (**L10N** [localization]; **locale-specific** design for **culture-sensitivity**)
2. Internationalization (**i18n** [internationalization]; design to multiple countries without much engineering changes)
3. Globalization (**g11n** [globalization]; design with both internationalization and localization)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iteration and prototypes
------------------------

Iteration and prototypes allow us to test the effectiveness and learn in the design process up-front.
Remember that **we cannot make it right the first time**; hence, learn then improve things along the way.

### The prototype cycle ###

1. Design (**transform** the abstract into concrete)
2. Prototype (**preliminary** artifact of the design)
3. Test (e.g. **usability testing** to evaluate a product by testing it on users)
4. Evaluate (**measure** and **learn** from the results)
5. Refine (**iterate** and **improve** the design and fix problems)

... then decide, **it is good enough**, then ship it (**release**).

And **good enough does not mean perfect**, but the start of the technology probe.

### The Local Maximum ###

[The Local Maximum](https://52weeksofux.com/post/694598769/the-local-maximum) is a phenomena by which a design cannot get much better simply because it has reached its peek.
Such that, starting with a dreadful design, and even fixing all of its problems, will still end up, dreadful.

A better approach is to always start with a **better design** (**global maximum**); that is, start somewhere better.
As such:

1. begin with a **very good starting point**
2. have a **better understanding** of:

   1. the problem
   2. target users
   3. the technology being built
   4. and how to connect them together
